# Beer-Rating

I built a Machine Learning model which predicts the overall rating of the beer. Considering constraints and questions which intrigued me, I have solved in the following manner:


1. How can we "beer/name", "beer/style" and "review/text" as features to predict the overall
rating of the beer?
2. Are there any words that strongly predict the overall rating of the beer?
3. How can we use other columns in train.csv to derive robust and effective features from them,
which can help to predict the overall rating of the beer?

I performed the following activities in sequential order to give a gist of my prediction:

1. Data cleaning and Data preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Modelling using 1-2 ML models
4. At Least 2-3 Model Validation metrics
